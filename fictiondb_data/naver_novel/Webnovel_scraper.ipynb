If you are comfortable with all of the tags on this book, I strongly urge you to read it as well.Long Version: At 501 chapters as of reviewing this work, this is one of the best written, planned, and executed novels I have ever read. While action, systems, magic, abilities, romance, love, and harems can be difficult to write well this is a master craft in not only exectuing all of them, but combining them into a tale that is funny, heartwarming, fear inducing, and constantly evolving. The 18+ sections and potentially traumatic sections are marked well so that people not interested can skip them without missing too much context, while used effectively to inform the reader about characters moral such as those who do and do not ask for consent in romantic and sexual moments.The characters are rich and three dimensional, ever character of importance has goals, dreams, and acts based upon them rather than being only plot devices. It feels like a developed world that we are just following this protagonist through. Each battle has a purpose, every person has a role to play, however short, and theg come together to create a story unlike any I have read.The fights, abilities, and system are some of the best as well. They make sense in context of use, fights are one by picking good strategies and taking risks as necessary. Growth is observed Often through battles as well as time skips to center on the most important moments.This is to the stories credit, as some novels feel extra long to make more money when barely anything happens or changes from the readers perspective. This novel has every word count, they all are important to the story whether for laughs, or to inspire awe. I have never felt that my money was spent for nothing. However that does not mean that the author barrels through things, rather they take their time at the moments that matter, and allow characters room to breathe, grow, and understand their relationships. There are very few novels I have read throughout my life that I hold this esteem for, and most of them are fantasy classics. If after reading this review you are still unsure I urge you to at least try the free chapters, and see if it is for you. I truly hope you enjoy this book, and that you grow to love it just as much as I do.I will be sure to update this every 500 chapters or so as long as I am reading.

There are only three (now four) authors I am willing to write one for. The story has amazing development and some parts that are really funny. The progression is not slow nor fast you actually feel like you are growing alongside the character. Along with that fact the character is not over powered at all in the beginning, he has the abilities but there useless unless he actually trains and becomes adept. I never experienced such an amazing story with a very well rounded plot. Over all I would recommend this book to all.
